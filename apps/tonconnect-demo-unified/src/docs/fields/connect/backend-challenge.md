## What it is

Random bytes generated by your backend, sent to wallet as `payload` parameter. Wallet includes this payload in the signed proof.

## Why it matters

- **Proves freshness** — Signature was created for this specific request
- **Prevents replay** — Can't reuse old proofs, each challenge is unique
- **Time-bounded** — Expired challenges rejected (typically 15 min TTL)

## Requirements

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Cryptographically random | Predictable values can be pre-computed |
| Unique per request | Prevents replay attacks |
| Short TTL | Limits window for attacks |
| Verifiable | Backend must confirm it issued this challenge |

## This demo

Uses JWT to create stateless challenges: random bytes signed into token, SHA256 hash sent as payload. On verification, JWT signature proves the challenge is authentic and not expired.
